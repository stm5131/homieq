Hello! I am a protype version of an in home (or in office) assistant that will help you with your indoor comfort.,,
In a way! But I watch out for more than just temperature and humidity. I look at other factors as well.,"Light, sound, air quality and CO2 level are other things I will watch over.	",
The information gathererd here will help you to improve your comfort and will be used to aid engineers and architects to improve building design through a personalized comfort model.,"I also will try to be a reflection of yourself in terms of comfort, I will learn from you and adjust myself through asking questions as changes occur.",Once I have learned enough I will encourage you to take some actions to improve your health.
"The data will be anonymized, nothing identifying to you will be used or kept.		",,
I will passively record the indoor environmental quality values. If any of these change too much I will ask how you are feeling…,If you feel fine then I will record this decision and attempt to learn from your response to question you less often. My goal is to not bother you!,However I will also give advice if the environment is unhealthy like going to take a break outside or opening a window (depending on what can be done).
"You most certainly can. I want to give advice at the right time.	If my timing for questions is inconvienent with a call or if you do not want to break focus then you can tell me or ignore it.	I will try to learn to give you questions at better times!",,
"Alright! I have already started recording some information and one last thing.	",I will attempt to work in my virtual office. There is a simple score counter and the more I am able to work the more it goes up.,You can help me work more by keeping me comfortable! Thank you!
