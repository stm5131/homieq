The information gathererd here will help you to improve your comfort and will be used to aid engineers and architects to improve building design through a personalized comfort model.,"I also will try to be a reflection of yourself in terms of comfort, I will learn from you and adjust myself through asking questions as changes occur.",Once I have learned enough I will encourage you to take some actions to improve your health.
"The data will be anonymized, nothing identifying to you will be used or kept.", , 
I will record your indoor environmental quality periodically and will ocasionally ask questions and learn from your answers and give suggestions., , 
You most certainly can. I want to give advice at the right time! If my questions are coming at the wrong time I will attempt to find a better time., ,
